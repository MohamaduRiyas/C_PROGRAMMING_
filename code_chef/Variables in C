A variable is like a labeled box where you can store data. Imagine you have a box labeled "age" and you put the number 25 in it. In C, you would do this by writing int age = 25;. This means you're storing the number 25 in the variable named age.

int denotes that we will be storing integers (numbers) in this variable.

Here's the cool part: whenever you use age in your code, C will remember it is 25. For example, if you write printf("%d", age), C will show 25.

Task
Create a variable in editor named age and assign the value 25 to it.
Print the value of age variable using print statement.



#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    // Replace __ with 25
    int age = __;
    printf("%d", age);
}

SOLUTION : 
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    // Replace __ with 25
    int age = 25;
    printf("%d", age);
}

Declaring a variable
When we declare a variable, we should also specify what type of variable it is. This is known as data type, basically meaning what type of data we are going to store in a variable.

Here are all the major data types and what they store in C:

Data Type	Description	Example Declaration
int	Stores whole numbers	int c = 100000;
long	Stores big whole numbers	long d = 100000L;
float	Stores small decimal numbers	float e = 10.5;
double	Stores big decimal numbers	double f = 10.5;
char	Stores single characters	char g = 'A';
Task
Write a program which does the following

Create an integer variable named number
Assign the value 19 to number
Output the value of number.


solution:
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    // Declare a variable
    int number = 19;
    
    // Print the variable
    printf("%d", number);
  
}
